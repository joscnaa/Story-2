I see I've mirrored myself onto you once again. Haven't I? I've done it once, and why would i not believe it can happen again. 
Why am I so afraid? Many times I've ignored this very question, asked by you and by me. I could'nt figure it out, but now I think I know why. It starts with the change of weather.
